**CellFinder**  
A semi-automated application in MatLab that detects the center of neurons in two-photon calcium images. This application utilizes the Gabor Annulus filter and Canny edge detection algorithm to automatically create an approximation of each cell body, and allows users to filter output to remove noise from the final data set.
